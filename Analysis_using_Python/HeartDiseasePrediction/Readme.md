# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis & Prediction

This project involves the analysis of heart disease-related data to understand risk factors and potentially build predictive models. Using data science tools, we explore patient health metrics and investigate patterns that may be indicative of cardiovascular risk.

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook `HEART.IPYNB` includes the following:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Visualization of key heart health indicators**
- (Optional) **Machine Learning modeling for prediction**

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand relationships between features like **age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain, etc.** and heart disease.
- Visualize data distributions and correlations.
- Build and evaluate a model to **predict heart disease presence** (if applicable).
- Derive insights to assist in early detection and prevention strategies.
